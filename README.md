# Executive Summary


Air pollution is one of the most widespread problem in India today. Breathing bad quality air has robbed the country with its significant opportunity to grow, and has costed huge human and economic losses. Monitoring and forecasting the status and trends of ambient air quality to ascertain air quality standards is one of the important step to address this issue.

This report presents results of forecasting the Air Quality Index for the City of Mumbai for the month of January 2017 using time series analysis. The report highlights performance of various time series models built to forecast the AQI based on four major pollutants â€“ PM10, PM2.5, SO2 and NO2 and using these results forecast the overall quality of air for Mumbai. The models are built using data driven and regression based techniques to obtain most accurate results. The performance evaluations of the adopted models are carried out on the basis of MAPE and RMSE. The results indicate that the models provide satisfactory predictions for the air quality parameters and can be used for practical assessment.
